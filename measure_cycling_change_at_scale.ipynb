    "Potential additional approach to speed up - extract full UK network 2016 vs 2021 and measure LTS etc. Then clip network to bounding boxes for each LSOA. Currently we dynamically pull network for LSOA, which means the same area will be extracted and have LTS measured multiple times. Not neccessarily incorrect approach, as scaling must also be considered (e.g., if pulling network scales non-linearly it may not be more efficient). Worth analysing two approach though once above resolved.\n",
